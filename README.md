## Reconnaissance
### Active Intelligence Gathering
Under this method, the targeted organization may become aware of the ongoing reconnaissance process since the pentester is actively engaging with the target. During this phase, he takes an active part in mapping network infrastructure, then he enumerates and/or scans the open services for vulnerabilities, and eventually searches for unpublished directories, files and servers. Other similar activities include OS Fingerprinting, Banner grabbing, and Web server application scan.
* **Nmap** is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network, thus building a "map" of the network. https://github.com/nmap/nmap
* **dnsrecon** a tool DNS Enumeration Script. https://github.com/darkoperator/dnsrecon
* **EyeWitness** is designed to take screenshots of websites, provide some server header info, and identify default credentials if possible. https://github.com/ChrisTruncer/EyeWitness
* **AWSBucketDump** is a tool to quickly enumerate AWS S3 buckets to look for loot. https://github.com/jordanpotti/AWSBucketDump
* **AQUATONE** is a set of tools for performing reconnaissance on domain names. https://github.com/michenriksen/aquatone
* **spoofcheck** a program that checks if a domain can be spoofed from. The program checks SPF and DMARC records for weak configurations that allow spoofing. https://github.com/BishopFox/spoofcheck

### Passive Intelligence Gathering
This option is under discussion provided that there is an explicit demand for the gathering activities not to be detected by the target. In this regard, the pentester cannot use tools that send traffic to the targeted company neither from his host nor an “anonymous” one across the Internet. Not only will that be technically burdening but also the person who performs the pentest will have to substantiate his findings with whatever he can dig out from archived or stored information, which is at times not up to date and incorrect because it has been limited to inquiries collected from third parties.
* **Spyse** Sybersecurity search engine that collects organization assets, web, technical & network data for cyber reconnaissance. https://spyse.com/

### Frameworks
In computer programming, a software framework is an abstraction in which software providing generic functionality can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software. A software framework provides a standard way to build and deploy applications.
* **Maltego** is a unique platform developed to deliver a clear threat picture to the environment that an organization owns and operates. https://www.paterva.com/web7/downloads.php
* **SpiderFoot** the open source footprinting and intelligence-gathering tool. https://github.com/smicallef/spiderfoot

## Social Engineering in the Context of Intelligence Gathering
Social engineering is deemed one of the most widespread avenues for gathering information on a particular individual or a firm. A lot of information is out there – just check the popular social media websites. Also, websites like Pipl, PeekYou, and Spokeo may come in handy as they will provide access to email addresses, locations, phone numbers, and even family tree information.

* **Eavesdropping** 
* **Shoulder Surfing** 

## Honeypot
A Honeypot is a computer security mechanism set to detect, deflect, or, in some manner, counteract attempts at unauthorized use of information systems. Generally, a honeypot consists of data (for example, in a network site) that appears to be a legitimate part of the site, but is actually isolated and monitored, and that seems to contain information or a resource of value to attackers, who are then blocked.
* **awesome-honeypots** The canonical awesome honeypot list. https://github.com/paralax/awesome-honeypots
* **HoneyPy** HoneyPy is a low to medium interaction honeypot. It is intended to be easy to: deploy, extend functionality with plugins, and apply custom configurations. https://github.com/foospidy/HoneyPy
* **Dionaea** Dionaea is meant to be a nepenthes successor, embedding python as scripting language, using libemu to detect shellcodes, supporting ipv6 and tls. https://github.com/DinoTools/dionaea
* **Conpot** ICS/SCADA Honeypot. Conpot is a low interactive server side Industrial Control Systems honeypot designed to be easy to deploy, modify and extend. By providing a range of common industrial control protocols we created the basics to build your own system, capable to emulate complex infrastructures to convince an adversary that he just found a huge industrial complex. To improve the deceptive capabilities, we also provided the possibility to server a custom human machine interface to increase the honeypots attack surface. The response times of the services can be artificially delayed to mimic the behaviour of a system under constant load. Because we are providing complete stacks of the protocols, Conpot can be accessed with productive HMI's or extended with real hardware. Conpot is developed under the umbrella of the Honeynet Project and on the shoulders of a couple of very big giants. https://github.com/mushorg/conpot
* **Amun** Amun Python-based low-interaction Honeypot. https://github.com/zeroq/amun
* **Glastopf** Glastopf is a Honeypot which emulates thousands of vulnerabilities to gather data from attacks targeting web applications. The principle behind it is very simple: Reply the correct response to the attacker exploiting the web application. https://github.com/mushorg/glastopf
* **Kippo** Kippo is a medium interaction SSH honeypot designed to log brute force attacks and, most importantly, the entire shell interaction performed by the attacker. https://github.com/desaster/kippo
* **Kojoney** Kojoney is a low level interaction honeypot that emulates an SSH server. The daemon is written in Python using the Twisted Conch libraries. https://github.com/hydrogen18/kojoney/blob/master/kojoney.py
* **HonSSH** HonSSH is a high-interaction Honey Pot solution. HonSSH will sit between an attacker and a honey pot, creating two separate SSH connections between them. https://github.com/tnich/honssh
* **Bifrozt** Bifrozt is a NAT device with a DHCP server that is usually deployed with one NIC connected directly to the Internet and one NIC connected to the internal network. What differentiates Bifrozt from other standard NAT devices is its ability to work as a transparent SSHv2 proxy between an attacker and your honeypot. If you deployed an SSH server on Bifrozt’s internal network it would log all the interaction to a TTY file in plain text that could be viewed later and capture a copy of any files that were downloaded. You would not have to install any additional software, compile any kernel modules or use a specific version or type of operating system on the internal SSH server for this to work. It will limit outbound traffic to a set number of ports and will start to drop outbound packets on these ports when certain limits are exceeded. https://github.com/Bifrozt
* **Cuckoo Sandbox** Cuckoo Sandbox is an Open Source software for automating analysis of suspicious files. To do so it makes use of custom components that monitor the behavior of the malicious processes while running in an isolated environment. https://cuckoosandbox.org/
## Weaponization
The cyber attacker does not interact with the intended victim. Instead, they create their attack. For example, the attacker may create an infected Microsoft Office document paired with a customized phishing email, or perhaps they create a new strain of self-replicating malware to be distributed via USB drive. There are few security controls, including security awareness, that may impact or neutralize this stage, unless the cyber attacker does some limited testing on the intended target.
